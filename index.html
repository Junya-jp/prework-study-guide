        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>HTML - Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development</li>
          <li>The head element contains information or metadata, that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li> Some elements of the head include the title,style,base,link and meta</li>
          <li>* The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for Search Engine Optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>* The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>* The base element defines the base URL for a webpage. </li>
          <li>* The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>* The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user. All the elements that we want the user to see and interact with must be placed inside this element.</li>
          <li>Headings - The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents. Headings are exactly what they sound like: larger or more prominent titles and subtitles to organize a page. </li>
          <li>Paragraphs - The p element represents a paragraph or block of text. You'll use this element extensively to wrap most of the text on your webpages.</li>
          <li>Lists - The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items. In essence, these HTML elements represent bulleted or numbered lists.</li>
          <li>image - The img element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image, as shown in the following code</li>
          <li>Hyperlink - Speaking of the hyperlink, the a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
        </ul>

          <li>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>Three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>The most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet</li>
          <li>a selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>As a note when using an external CSS style sheet we must remember to link it in original html file</li>

        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Git and Github - The version control software and cloud hosting service that we will use to track changes in our code and store these changes as versions.</li>
          <li>Git commands - Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code. Using Git commands, we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>git commit -m - command to show modified files in working directory, staged for your next commit</li>
          <li>git status - Show modified files in working directory staged for next commit.</li>
          <li>repository - project on github commonly called a repo. afolder that contains all files and revision history</li>
          <li>Branch - workplace you can make changes without affecting live site. Branches can be created using command git branch [branch-name]</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>git checkout is used to switch to another branch </li>
          <li>markdown(.md) - The way content files are formatted in github.</li>
          <li>Pull Request - Asking for changes on a branch to merge with another branch.</li>
          <li>Merge - When a PR is approved  changes are “pulled in” or merged into main branch.</li>
          <li>Issues - ways to report new tasks or content fixes</li>

          <li>JavaScript (JS) is a high-level dynamic programming language that allows users to interact with websites.</li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data. Arrays are typically used to hold data that is related in some way.</li>
          <li>We can use conditional statements and loops to control the order in which code is executed</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task. you must call a function by name in order to execute it. While that may seem like extra work, having a block of code that executes only when we call it makes the code more easily reusable, because we can call it as many times as we need</li>
